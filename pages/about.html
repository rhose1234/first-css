    <h1>This is our About Page</h1>
    <p>My journey at APTECH ITSSC has been a mix of learning, challenges, and personal growth. I joined APTECH because I wanted a structured environment that would keep me committed to my learning, and while it has provided that, there have been obstacles along the way. The instructor switch during my C programming class disrupted my learning, as I struggled to adjust to the new teaching style. Additionally,

        Another major challenge is the limited time after class. The 30-minute period isnâ€™t enough to properly collaborate with classmates, discuss assignments, or work on projects. While I understand the power constraints affecting extended lab time, I strongly feel there should be a dedicated space where students can work without having to pay, i mean the fee alone on its own is a lot. The alternative workspace is too expensive at 5K per day, making it inaccessible for most students.
        
        Despite these challenges, I remain committed to my learning. I look forward to gaining more hands-on experience, improving my programming skills, and finding better ways to navigate the difficulties. My goal is to maximize my time at APTECH and grow into a skilled software developer.
